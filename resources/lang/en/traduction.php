    'p1'=>"Charity is the primary motivation behind nature, love is not a virtue to be adopted or displayed. But in all areas of life it can be very well adjusted. Being kind to neighbors and their co-workers contributes to the development of a positive social environment. Even small decisions and selfless acts of kindness can contribute to creation. This word gives a positive impression of being nice to others, making it a better place to live.",
    'p2'=>"Charity is a value designed to help the community or a certain group of people in the areas of education and humanitarian assistance. It surpasses philanthropy and helping the poor, but extends to spreading happiness and supporting many important causes. Charitable giving is something that is donated by people, a public assistance institution or a group of society as a whole.",

    'p4'=>"Philanthropy is important and is done for the public interest, comfort and assistance to people in need in any part of the world, especially those who are victims of war, natural disasters, hunger, disease, poverty, orphans by providing them with food, shelter, medical assistance and other basic needs. The greatest giving we will give to our society will be our contribution to making the lives of others better, when we touch this life of others with donations or charity, as well as spreading light to most of those in need and enlightening our lives at this stage.",
